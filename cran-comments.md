## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* added dontrun for long-running example code for bMCTtest
  
## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* Marius Thomas is taking over as maintainer from Bj√∂rn Bornkamp from this version.

## Reverse dependency checks

We checked 10 reverse dependencies and noticed one new issue for the MCPModgeneral package:

The maintainer was notified on Aug 7 and a fix was proposed. The maintainer has now updated his package but the fix has been applied incompletely in MCPModGeneral so revdepchecks still show errors. We have again notified the maintainer today (Aug 23) that the issue persists and which remaining fixes need to be made.
